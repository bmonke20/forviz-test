There are room `A101`, `A102` and `Auditorium` available for booking. These are some json data from current bookings (Booking Data).
Base on the data, please create

    1. Create a function that accept room, startTime, endTime and return if the room is available for booking. The room is available if thereâ€™re no other current bookings during requested start - end time.
    2. Create a function that return all current bookings that occur `today`, `this week`  and `next week` for a room.

Be careful, some bookings last more than one day, and some goes between weeks ( Saturday to next Tuesday, for example)
